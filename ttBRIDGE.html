				Declarer's Play</span></b></u></e><br>
			<u>Key Pointers About Sure Tricks</u>
			<ol>
				<li>The first step in playing a bridge hand as declarer is to 
					count your sure tricks.</li> 
				<li>A sure trick is a trick that can be taken without giving up the lead.</li>
				<li>You can never take more tricks in a suit than there are cards in 
					the longer hand. (If both you and your dummy have two cards in 
					one suit, the most tricks you can take in that suit is two.)</li> 
				<li>When taking sure tricks, play the high cards(s) from the short side 
					first. This will allow you to end up on the long side, where you 
					can cash the rest of the tricks in the suit.</li>
			</ol>
			<span id="tab" style="color:gray;">Whenever you have a bunch of good tricks in a suit 
			that is unevenly divided, you should play the high card(s) from the short side first.<br>
			Playing the high card or high cards from the short side first allows us to <u>end 
			up on the long side</u>, where we can take the maximum number of tricks.
			</span>
			<br><br>
			<u>Key Pointers About Establishing Tricks</u>
			<ol>
				<li>When playing a hand as declarer, know how many tricks you must take 
					to fulfill your contract.</li>
				<li>Count your sure tricks and, if you do not have enough, look for suits 
					that can be established (usually suits that are missing the ace 
					or the king). Once you lose a trick to the high card, the rest of 
					your cards in that suit will be good.</li>
				<li>Do your establishing early. Establish first and then take your sure tricks.</li>
				<li>If you take your sure tricks too soon, you may find that when you start 
					establishing, the opponents will by that time have good tricks 
					established in the suits in which you hastily cashed your sure tricks.</li>
				<li>Do not be afraid to give up the lead. On most hands you must give up the 
					lead two or three times.</li>
				<li>When playing equal cards (such as the jack, ten, and nine), declarer 
					should usually play his highest equal first. This applies to both 
					establishing and taking. By doing this, you make it harder for the opponents 
					to know what is going on. If you have the ace, king, and queen of spades 
					and you play the queen, naturally it will take the trick, but your 
					opponents will know that you still have the king and ace. However, if you 
					play the ace first, the opponents will not know who has the king and queen.<br> 
				    When playing equal cards from the dummy, it does not matter which one you 
				    	play first, because the opponents can see the dummy. However, just to 
				    	stay in practice, you should take the highest equal from dummy also.</li>
			</ol>
			<span id="tab" style="color:gray;">
				When it comes to establishing tricks, you follow the same general rule that you 
				did when you were taking your sure tricks. <u>Play the high card(s) from the 
				short side first</u>. 
				<br><br>				
				In planning the play of a contract <u>count the sure tricks 
				you have and see how many more tricks you can establish</u>.<br> 
				NB to keep the two counts separate until you have actually established 
				some tricks. Once you establish some tricks, you can <u>add the tricks</u> you 
				have established to your sure trick count.<br>

		   Defender`s Play</span></b></u></e><br>
			
			Defense is most difficult aspect of playing bridge. Many become adequate 
			bidders by simply <u>memorizing point count for various bids</u>.
			But defense is a matter of logic and thus separates the men from the boys.<br>
			If you are a strong defender it is almost impossible to be a losing player. 
			At least half of your opponents` contracts can be defeated with a good 
			defense, but the sad truth is that about eighty percent of contracts 
			are fulfilled.<br><br>
			
			<u>Key Pointers About Opening Leads Against Notrump</u>
			   <ol>
			     	<li>In order to select the correct opening lead you must listen to the bidding.</li>
			     	<li>With no clues from the bidding the opening leader normally leads his longest suit.</li>
			     	<li>Sequence leads are better than fourth-best leads and take precedence over them. 
			     		A four-card suit headed by a sequence is usually a better lead than a longer 
			     		suit without a sequence.</li> 
				<li>Avoid leading suits that the opponents have bid unless you have three-card 
					or longer sequences in those suits.</li>
				<li>Aces, kings, queens, jacks, and tens are honors. The more honor cards you 
					have in a particular suit the more apt you are to lead the suit. 
					A lead from K 10 4 2 is preferable to a lead from K 8 6 2.</li>
				<li>If partner has bid, especially if he has overcalled, tend to lead his suit. 
					An exception occurs when you happen to have a very strong opening 
					lead of your own (K Q J x x, for instance, with a way of gaining the 
					lead in another suit).</li>
				<font color=green>	
				<li>When leading from length you lead (a) fourth highest or (b) top of a sequence, or (c) the jack from 
					a holding that includes A J 10 or K J 10, or (d) the ten from a holding that 
					includes A 10 9, K 10 9, Q 10 9, A Q 10 9, or A K 10 9, or (e) the ace from a holding 
					that includes A K Q J, A K Q 10, A K J 10, A Q J 10.</li>
				<li>When leading from a three-card holding headed by one honor (A x x, K x x, Q x x, J x x, 10 x x) 
					lead your lowest card. When leading from a three-card holding headed by no 
					honors 9 x x, 8 x x, 7 x x, etc., lead your top card.</li>
				<li>When leading from a three-card holding that has two honor cards, lead the top honor if they are 
					touching and the lowest card if they are not. (Exception: king from A K x.)</li>
				<li>When leading from any two-card holding, lead the top card.</li>
				</font>
				<li>The rules for opening leads do not necessarily apply to leads later in the play, when common sense 
					may dictate a deviation.</li>
				<li>As a general rule, honor leads show sequences, high middle cards tend to be top of nothing, 
					and low cards tend to be fourth best. The lead of the nine always shows the highest card in that suit.</li>
				<li>Always keep your objective in mind. You are trying to set up your suit or your partner`s suit 
					before declarer can set up his suit or suits. You have a head start because the defense 
					makes the opening lead. Do not waste your opportunity.

				<u>Roth Point Count</u> is more exciting than old-fashioned count, for it 
				enables you to see the value of your hand change in front of your eyes as
				the result of the bids you and your partner make. When partner's bids signal 
				good news, your points go up; when partner's bids flash warning 
				signals, your points go down.

				<u>? open with 1 notrump or with one of a suit</u>: There are 3 requirements for the 
					one-notrump opening bid; if your hand meets all of them, you should open 
					one notrump. However, if you fail to satisfy any one of the three 
					requirements, you must reject the notrump opening and open with one of a suit. 
					The requirements for the opening bid of one notrump are: <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. 16-18 HCP. (You may not open one notrump with more than 18 HCP)<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Balanced suit distribution: 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2. <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. High-card points in at least three of the four suits.<br>
				Once you have decided to open one notrump, you should not count your Distribution Points. 
				It is impossible to ruff anything in a notrump contract.<br>
				The notrump bid is subject to exact requirements & so connvey to your partner a 
				great deal of information about your hand.
			     </li>
			     <li>
				Open bidding with two clubs any time you have 24 or more points.<br>
				It says nothing about your holding in clubs; it is a legal method of informing 
				partner that you have at least 24 points and that <u>both of you must continue to 
				bid until at least game is reached</u>. Since partner is not permitted to pass 
				two clubs (game has not been reached), you will get another chance to bid and 
				can then bid your longest suit.

	<button class="accordion">2 Player Bridge</button>
	<div class="panel">

		<u>Honeymoon Bridge</u> can be applied to any adaptation of Contract Bridge for two players.<br>
		There are several versions. All of them use a 52-card pack, with suits and cards in each 
		suit ranking as in Bridge. Scoring is the same as in Rubber Bridge.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>https://www.pagat.com/auctionwhist/honeymoon.html#single</i>
		<ul>
			<li>Draw Bridge<br>
			   <span id="tab" style="opacity:0.5;"> 
			   	2 players use 52 card pack. Deals 13 cards to each player. Remaining 26 
				cards placed face in pile (the stock) from which cards are drawn. 
				1st 13 tricks played at no trump. Non dealer leads to the first trick, 
				& it is not necessary to follow suit. These tricks do not count towards 
				the score - they are simply discarded - but the winner of each trick 
				draws the top card from the top of the stock and the loser takes the next card. 
				When drawing a card you add it to your hand without showing it to your opponent.
				After 13 tricks each player still has 13 cards, and if they have very good 
				memories they will know each other's hands. The players now bid as in Contract
				Bridge (doubles and redoubles are allowed), until one player passes. 
				The final contract is then played, the opponent of the bidder leading to the 
				first trick. Suit must be followed, as in Bridge.
			   </span>
			</li>
			<li>Draw and Discard Bridge</li>
			<li>Double Dummy Bridge
			   <span id="tab" style="opacity:0.5;">
				The two active players sit next to each other. Four 13-card hands are dealt 
				as in Bridge - a hand for each player and two dummy hands. The hand opposite 
				each player is their dummy, but they cannot look at it until after the bidding.<br>
				The two players bid as in Contract Bridge (doubles and redoubles allowed) 
				until one player passes. The players then look at their own dummies, but 
				do not show them to each other until after the opening lead.<br>
				The declarer`s opponent leads a card to the first trick from the hand that will 
				be to declarer`s left: this will be the opponent`s own hand if the declarer 
				is the right-hand player, but the opponent`s dummy if the declarer is the 
				left-hand player. Both dummies are then exposed on the table, opposite 
				their owners, and play continues as in Bridge, each of the players playing 
				cards from their own dummy at its turn.<br><br>
				Variations:<br>
				Some play that neither dummy is exposed to the opponent. After the end of 
				the bidding, the dummy cards are placed in racks so that they are visible 
				to the owner throughout the play, but not to the other player.
				Hans Peter Albach suggests that when playing this way, the two players should 
				sit facing each other across the table, each having their opponent's rack 
				in front of them to their left. So if South and East are the real players, 
				with North and West as their dummy partners, the arrangement and sequence 
				of play looks like this:<br><br>
				<IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 200px; border: 2px black solid; 
				background-color: black;" alt="2X" src="2Xdummy.jpeg" ><br>
				To eliminate any positional advantage in sitting to the left or right, 
				some play that the hands are always arranged, after the bidding, 
				in the clockwise order: opponent's dummy, declarer's dummy, opponent, 
				declarer. In this case the opponent's dummy leads to the first trick.<br><br>

				Some deal just 12 cards to each player initially. Players may look at their 
				own dummies during the bidding. After the bidding, the dealer deals two 
				more cards to each player. The players look at these extra cards and 
				choose which to add to their own hand and which to their dummy.
