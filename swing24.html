					Gravity starts downswing, and all you do is exert force right before clubface makes contact with ball.
					Take your backswing, and let gravity do the work to start your downsing. Grip the club loosely and just let it start to fall. The <u>longer you can wait until the moment you tense up, the better</u> your results will be.<br>

					The more moving parts in a golf swing, the more that can go wrong.
					Proper wrist action and wrist hinge are essential to shorten your backswing and not lose power.<br>
					Just because you are taking a shorter backswing does not mean you need a quicker backswing. Do not change your tempo or your pace, or things will get sloppy.<br>
					Can Cause a Loss of Distance without the <u>Proper Wrist Hinge</u>.
					A concept not talked about widely enough is the proper wrist hinge when it comes to a shorter backswing. If you are a player that hinges your wrists at the very top of your swing, you will lose quite a bit of distance when switching to the shorter swing.	
					The key is to <u>take a shorter swing with a <span style="background:lime;"><b>quicker</b> wrist hinge</u></span>, and then you can get great power.<br>
					Take a shorter swing, consciously trying to increase radial deviation without overextending your wrist.<br>
					Ensure you are <span style="background:lime;"><u>rotating your body and not just swinging your arms back</u></span>. Some players get confused by the concept of shorter swing and allow the arms to completely take over.
					Look for great body <span style="background:lime;">rotation, an earlier wrist hinge, and <b>proper tempo</b></span> throughout your shorter backswing.

					One of the keys to a good backswing is putting yourself in an ideal position for the arms to accelerate through the ball. Thatâ€™s why massively long arm swings are so bad. Most people cannot get from the top back to the ball by accelerating.<br>
