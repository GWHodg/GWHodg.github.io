		<li>
			<b>Be Sure the Power is On</b>:<br>
			Check that the well switch located near your pressure tank hasn't been switched off. 
			Then check the well's double-pole circuit breaker to see that it hasn't tripped. 
			A breaker that keeps tripping likely means a problem with the well pump, and you'll need to call a pro.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Rock the Tank:</b><br>
			Push against the top of the tank to rock it slightly. 
			If you can't rock it or it feels top heavy, it's bad. 
			Drain it and replace it.<br>
			<br>
			
		</li>			
		<li>	  

		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Check the Pressure Switch</b>:<br>
			<font size=2>
			You'll find the pressure switch mounted on a 1/4-in. tube near the pressure tank.
			It's what senses when water pressure has dropped to the point where the pressure tank requires more water. The switch then powers up the well pump.<br>
			If the switch is bad, it won't start the well pump and you won't have water, so <i><b>testing the switch is your first step</b></i>.
			Remove the cover and bang a screwdriver handle sharply against the tube below the switch to jar the electrical contacts.
			If you see a spark and the pump starts, the pressure switch is the problem.<br>
			</font>
			<br>
			<b>Temporary Quick Fix</b>:<br>
			<font size=2>
			If banging on the tube under the pressure switch kicked on the well pump, it means the contact surfaces of the electrical contacts are pitted or burned, causing a poor connection. You can temporarily restore the surfaces to keep it going until you can buy a replacement switch.<br>	
			First, <b><u>turn off the power</u></b> and double-check with a voltage tester.
			Pull the contacts open and file off the burned and pitted areas using an ordinary nail file or emery board.<br>
			<i><b>Replace the pressure switch as soon as possible because this fix won't last long.</b></i>
			<u>CONFIRM THE POWER IS OFF!</u> Before you replace the pressure switch or file the contacts, turn off the power at the main panel and check the wires with a non-contact voltage tester.

	<br>WHAT TO DO IF YOUR WELL STOPS WORKING<br>
	<ul id='col2'>
		<li>
			<b>AQUIFER DEPLETION & GROUNDWATER PROBLEMS</b><br>			
			If you <i>have running water first thing in the morning, lose it throughout the day intermittently, and then it <b>returns</b> when you come home from work</i>, then it could be a sign of <b>aquifer depletion</b>. For the well pump system to work effectively, the recharge rate in the well would at least have to match that of the pump rate.<br>
			Water availability can vary from year to year, but generally, if your well is drilled deep enough, you shouldn’t have to deal with water loss. A typical well drilled in Florida needs to go at least 200 ft <i>down to the bedrock</i> of the aquifer. If the well was drilled only until it hit first water, then you’re less likely to have reliable water supply from the aquifer. <!--At Perry’s Pump Repair, our wells are always drilled until it hits the bedrock of the aquifer.-->	<br>		
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>CHECK THE TANK PRESSURE</b><br>
			Find the <b>pressure gauge</b> on your pressure tank and read the pressure. If it is not showing a pressure of <b><i>30-50 psi</i></b> or 40-60 psi, that indicates a problem with the electrical pressure switch.<br>
			If you are experiencing a water pressure problem, try <b>manually closing the pressure control switch</b>. Doing so <b>should turn the pump on</b>. Then, close the switch, and if the pump doesn’t turn on then the <i><b>problem is with the pump</b></i> itself.<br>

				<b>Prevent water intake reaching filter:</b><br>
				The first handle <b>to</b> your water filter you'll want to turn off. This prevents the water intake from reaching your filter.<br><br>
				The second handle <b>after</b> your water filter you'll want to turn off. This <b><i>prevents a back flow of water in the line from coming back to you when you open the filter housing</i></b>.<br>	<br>	
				<font size=1>
				<i>Whole House Water Filter Bypass</i>: The third handle is the <i>bypass handle</i> that should have been off (ie it was forcing the water to go through your water filter). You'll now want to open this handle. This means that if your water line is still on (or not completely shut off) it will continue on by passing the water filter. This setup is what you would do if you end up with a leaky whole house water filter that you need to bypass while you make repairs but still providing unfiltered water to the rest of the house.<br>
				</font>

		  	</li>	
			<li  style="list-style-type:circle;">
				<b>Opening the Big Blue Filter Cannister:</b><br>
				<font size=2>Better whole house filter systems have a <b>red button</b> on top that lets you release the water pressure in the line to make it easier to open the housing. If you have this red button and your water is shut off go ahead and press it. If you hear pressure releasing you have just saved yourself a lot of arm wrestling with the wrench.<br></font>
				With the <b>bucket under</b> your whole house <b>filter</b> and your wrench around the filter go ahead and <b>turn <u>counter clockwise</u></b> <font size=1>(once you figure it out mark an arrow on your housing so you won't have to use your brain)</font>. If you are slow minded like me you'll grab a jar and unthread the lid by holding the lid and turning the jar to visually compare which way you should be turning.<br>
				If it starts to move proceed SLOWLY. A lot of water is likely to start coming out and you <i><b>don't want to completely remove the filter housing until you verify the water lets up</b></i>. <font size=2>If you completely remove the housing and your water is still turned on you are going to have one heck of a time trying to get it back on or rushing out to shut off your main water line.</font><br>
			</li>	
		
			<li>
				<b>Inspect the Old Filter and Clean Out the Filter Housing</b><br>
				Pour the filter housing water into the bucket below and look for any big sediment pieces that might indicate you are getting contaminated water from a broken water line. <font size=2>The water should smell fine, if it doesn't it might be a problem with your water source (fracking near water wells) or a lack of chlorination for water utility lines. Investigate any serious issues.</font><br>				
				Pull out the disposable filter. <font size=2>These are supposed to be replaced every 6 months, but in my case it had been almost 2 years!</font> The outside of the filter is where the water comes in so all the debris should be on this side of the filter. Take a look inside the center filter ring to see how it looks <font size=2>(this is the filtered water that proceeds out to your faucet). If you see small black flecks it may be from a charcoal filter. If you see rusty metal flakes it probably means you have steel pipes that are starting to deteriorate. A small amount of sand is not unusual. A lot of sand, pebbles or concrete pieces is not normal.</font><br>		
				Take a look at the <b>bottom of the filter housing for more debris</b>. Rinse it out and use a clean rag to wipe down the insides and outsides of the canister.<br>
				Clean out the <b>threads of the canister</b> as well as the threads of the cannister holder bracketed to the wall. You may find chunks of debris lodged in here from opening the canister. It is important to clean this out well. Use a Q-Tip or <i>tooth brush</i> and then wipe it clean with your rag.<br>
			</li>	
			<li>
				<b>Putting the Replacement Filter In</b><br>
				   Put the filter into the housing so that it is <b><i>perfectly centered</i></b>. If it is off center or you tilt it while you thread it, you are likely to damage the top of the filter as it smashing into the brackets designed to help guide the canister housing back on.<br>		
					<font size=2>Take the time to look at your filter in the canister and at the threads you are screwing it onto.<br>
					You do NOT need the filter or strap wrench. The usual protocol is to hand tighten only. It will go on easy enough and once the water is in it will be difficult to unthread until the system is depressurized.<br>
					That said, too loose and you'll leak. Some folks cheat and do a little monkey tight (not gorilla tight) with the filter wrench, but this step is done because they didn't install a new O-ring, use silicone grease and/or PTFE tape.</font><br> 
					<br><br>
				If possible <b>leave the bucket under the water filter</b> for the next filter change, or in the case you have any leaks.<br>
				<br>
				<font size=1>If you don't have a <b><u>water leak detector</u></b> installed this is a good time to get one. I have the <u>Gentronics</u> water detector, which allows you to set the alarm farther away from where the leak is detected. <i>Honeywell</i> also makes one. They cost less than <b>$15</b> and can save you thousands in repair bills. They use a <i>9 volt battery</i> and only use the battery power when water completes the circuit - making a loud buzz for you to go and turn off the water.<br>
					If you already have a water detector now is a good time to wet your finger and test it to make sure it is still working.<br></font>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><u>SLOWLY</u> Pressurize the Water System</b><br>
				Don't just go and turn the water system back on to full pressure and not expect a leak!<br>	
				Some folks turn on the water, only to find out the canister fell off and water is spraying everywhere!<br>
				I recommend slowly turning the water to 1/4 open and listening to the pipes. If you have someone else turn on the water while you watch you can catch any problems quickly. Leaks will either appear as a steady stream of drops down the side or a huge geyser of spray at the connection.<br>
				If you have bypass valves at the water filter go ahead and turn off the bypass and do a slow 1/4 open on the water into the filter, and then a 1/4 open on the water out. You should hear water rushing through the system, and if your faucet or hose is open you should hear it gurgle as it pushes out the air followed by the water.<br>
				<font size=1>This is a good time to check for rust and debris getting flushed out in the lines. If you see this you should let the water run until it goes clean before proceeding. Once the water is running clear you should go up to the highest water outlet in your house (usually an upstairs shower) and turn it on to purge any air out of the water lines.<br></font>
				If there is any sign of leakage shut everything down. If it looks okay go ahead and go to 1/2 water pressure and then full water pressure.<br>
